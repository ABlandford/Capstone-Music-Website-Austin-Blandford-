# Capstone-Music-Website-Austin-Blandford-
My second attempt at Capstone with a music website that comes with many options and features. From learning tabs for guitar to finding lyrics for a song!

# Technologies
I used a multitude of technologies for the full stack of this website. All technologies had a core piece in the stack and provided a clean experience for a user when using my website, which I dubbed Music Hub.

## The Stack

### Front-End
I used ReactJS for the front-end portion of this project. Using ReactJS, I made a standard front-end using a blue color scheme I came up with using my 4 years of Graphic Design experience. With ReactJS, I was able to have a stable UI that was easy to follow and understand. Specific messages will show up when a user is in the website and is not logged in to an account. See the screenshots below!
